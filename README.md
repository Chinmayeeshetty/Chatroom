## Introduction

The chat room application consists of two main components: a server and multiple clients. The server listens for incoming connections from clients and facilitates communication between them. Clients can connect to the server and send messages to each other through the server.

## Features

- Server-client architecture for real-time communication.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- Support for multiple clients connecting simultaneously.
- Broadcast messages to all connected clients.
- Error handling for graceful termination.

## How to Use

1. Compile the provided source code for both the server and client applications using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the server application on a host machine using the specified IP address and port.
3. Run multiple instances of the client application on different machines or terminals.
4. Connect each client to the server using the specified IP address and port.
5. Start sending messages between clients in the chat room.

## Setup

To set up the chat room application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the server and client source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled server executable on a host machine.
4. Run multiple instances of the compiled client executable on different machines or terminals.
5. Connect each client to the server using the specified IP address and port.
